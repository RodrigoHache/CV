However, cerebro-vascular diseases can affect blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. Cerebral autoregulation is a primary function of cerebral hemodynamics, which allows to maintain a relatively constant blood flow despite changes in arterial blood pressure and perfusion pressure.

	abstract = {Functional MRI is based on changes in cerebral microvasculature triggered by increased neuronal oxidative metabolism. This change in blood flow follows a pattern known as the hemodynamic response function (HRF), which typically peaks 4–6 s following stimulus delivery. However, in the presence of cerebrovascular disease the HRF may not follow this normal pattern, due to either the temporal signal to noise (tSNR) ratio or delays in the HRF, which may result in misinterpretation or underestimation of fMRI signal. The present study examined the HRF and SNR in five individuals with aphasia resulting from stroke and four unimpaired participants using a lexical decision task and a long trial event-related design. T1-weighted images were acquired using an MP-RAGE sequence and BOLD T2*-weighted images were acquired using Echo Planar Imaging to measure time to peak (TTP) in the HRF. Data were analyzed using Brain Voyager in four anatomic regions known to be involved in language processing: Broca’s area and the posterior perisylvian network (PPN) (including Wernicke’s area, the angular and supramarginal gyri) and right hemisphere homologues of these regions. The occipital area also was examined as a control region. Analyses showed that the TTP in three out of five patients in the left perisylvian area was increased significantly as compared to normal individuals and the left primary visual cortex in the same patients. In two other patients no significant delays were detected. We also found that the SNR for BOLD signal detection may by insufficient in damaged areas. These findings indicate that obtaining physiologic (TTP) and quality assurance (tSNR) information is essential for studying activation patterns in brain-damaged patients in order to avoid errors in interpretation of the data. An example of one such misinterpretation and the need for alternative data analysis strategies is discussed.},

We aimed to characterize HRF in human infants before and after the normal time of birth using rapid sampling of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. A somatosensory stimulus and an event related experimental design were used to collect data from 10 healthy adults, 15 sedated infants at term corrected post menstrual age (PMA) (median 41+1weeks), and 10 preterm infants (median PMA 34+4weeks). A positive amplitude HRF waveform was identified across all subject groups, with a systematic maturational trend in terms of decreasing time-to-peak and increasing positive peak amplitude associated with increasing age. Application of the age-appropriate HRF models to fMRI data significantly improved the precision of the fMRI analysis. These findings support the notion of a structured development in the brain's response to stimuli across the last trimester of gestation and beyond.},

	abstract = {The main challenge in the field of neurocognitive ageing is to understand the brain mechanisms that might underlie age differences in cognitive performance or why some functions are maintained into older age.A number of ideas have been suggested to explain age differences in brain activity during cognitive tasks, including compensation, dedifferentiation and less efficient use of neural resources. Although there is evidence to support all of these theories, there is also evidence to the contrary, and it is not yet clear whether one is more characteristic of ageing than the others.Recently, there has been increasing interest in examining the effects of age on large-scale brain networks. One of these in particular, the default network, appears to be especially vulnerable to the effects of age.There is evidence that age differences in brain structure can influence the relationship between activity in task-related brain regions and behaviour, indicating a complex interplay between structure and function.There is a growing literature on how various risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, such as the apolipoprotein Egene and mild cognitive impairment, affect task-related brain activity in older adults. This work also highlights the similarities between age differences in healthy older versus younger adults and differences between adults with mild cognitive impairment and controls, suggesting a continuum of effects due to age and neuropathological brain changes.Future work should aim to more clearly define compensatory brain activity, make more use of lifespan and longitudinal approaches and attempt to account for the large number of factors that influence the ageing process, which vary from individual to individual and include genetics and life experiences.},

In the second experiment, at high temporal resolution (TR = 294 ms), we measured the response to an impulse stimulus in these voxels. We found that the shape of the time course changes systematically with age. Among the parameters whose age dependence we determined quantitatively, we found the smallest effect for the latency of the leading edge. Therefore, in order to avoid the potential confounds resulting from this effect, it may be appropriate to use the latency of the leading edge or the peak intensity of the BOLD signal, rather than its trailing edge or the area under the signal, as the salient variable in event-related studies that compare groups of different age.},

	abstract = {Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease that leads to multiple vascular complications with concomitant changes in human neurophysiology, which may lead to long-term cognitive impairment, and dementia. Early impairments of neurovascular coupling can be studied using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) designs. Here, we aimed to characterize the changes in the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in T2DM to probe components from the initial dip to late undershoot. We investigated whether the HRF morphology is altered throughout the brain in T2DM, by extracting several parameters of the fMRI response profiles in 141 participants (64 patients with T2DM and 77 healthy controls) performing a visual motion discrimination task. Overall, the patients revealed significantly different HRFs, which extended to all brain regions, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon. The HRF in T2DM was found to be more sluggish, with a higher peak latency and lower peak amplitude, relative slope to peak, and area under the curve. It also showed a pronounced initial dip, suggesting that the initial avidity for oxygen is not compensated for, and an absent or less prominent but longer undershoot. Most HRF parameters showed a higher dispersion and variability in T2DM. In sum, we provide a definite demonstration of an impaired hemodynamic response function in the early stages of T2DM, following a previous suggestion of impaired neurovascular coupling. The quantitative demonstration of a significantly altered HRF morphology in separate response phases suggests an alteration of distinct physiological mechanisms related to neurovascular coupling, which should be considered in the future to potentially halt the deterioration of the brain function in T2DM.},

	abstract = {Most current analysis methods for fMRI data assume a priori knowledge of the time course of the hemodynamic response (HR) to experimental stimuli or events in brain areas of interest. In addition, they typically assume homogeneity of both the HR and the non-HR “noise” signals, both across brain regions and across similar experimental events. When HRs vary unpredictably, from area to area or from trial to trial, an alternative approach is needed. Here, we use Infomax independent component analysis (ICA) to detect and visualize variations in single-trial HRs in event-related fMRI data. Six subjects participated in four fMRI sessions each in which ten bursts of 8-Hz flickering-checkerboard stimulation were presented for 0.5-s (short) or 3-s (long) durations at 30-s intervals. Five axial slices were acquired by a Bruker 3-T magnetic resonance imager at interscan intervals of 500 ms (TR). ICA decomposition of the resulting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) data from each session produced an independent component active in primary visual cortex (V1) and, in several sessions, another active in medial temporal cortex (MT/V5). Visualizing sets of BOLD response epochs with novel BOLD-image plots demonstrated that component HRs varied substantially and often systematically across trials as well as across sessions, subjects, and brain areas. Contrary to expectation, in four of the six subjects the V1 component HR contained two positive peaks in response to short-stimulus bursts, while components with nearly identical regions of activity in long-stimulus sessions from the same subjects were associated with single-peaked HRs. Thus, ICA combined with BOLD-image visualization can reveal dramatic and unforeseen HR variations not apparent to researchers analyzing their data with event-related response averaging and fixed HR templates.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Conventional analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using the general linear model (GLM) employs a neural model convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) peaking 5 s after stimulation. Incorporation of a further basis function, namely the canonical HRF temporal derivative, accounts for delays in the hemodynamic response to neural activity. A population that may benefit from this flexible approach is children whose hemodynamic response is not yet mature. Here, we examined the effects of using the set based on the canonical HRF plus its temporal derivative on both first- and second-level GLM analyses, through simulations and using developmental data (an fMRI dataset on proprioceptive mapping in children and adults). Simulations of delayed fMRI first-level data emphasized the benefit of carrying forward to the second-level a derivative boost that combines derivative and nonderivative beta estimates. In the experimental data, second-level analysis using a paired {\textless}italic{\textgreater}t{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-test showed increased mean amplitude estimate (i.e., increased group contrast mean) in several brain regions related to proprioceptive processing when using the derivative boost compared to using only the nonderivative term. This was true especially in children. However, carrying forward to the second-level the individual derivative boosts had adverse consequences on random-effects analysis that implemented one-sample {\textless}italic{\textgreater}t{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-test, yielding increased between-subject variance, thus affecting group-level statistic. Boosted data also presented a lower level of smoothness that had implication for the detection of group average activation. Imposing soft constraints on the derivative boost by limiting the time-to-peak range of the modeled response within a specified range (i.e., 4–6 s) mitigated these issues. These findings support the notion that there are pros and cons to using the informed basis set with developmental data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Until the advent of non-invasive neuroimaging modalities the knowledge of the human brain came from the study of its lesions, post-mortem analyses and invasive experimentations. Nowadays, modern imaging techniques such as fMRI are revealing several aspects of the human brain with progressively high spatio-temporal resolution. However, in order to answer increasingly complex neuroscientific questions the technical improvements in acquisition must be matched with novel data analysis methods. In this thesis we examine different applications of machine learning to the processing of fMRI data. We propose novel extensions and investigate the theoretical properties of different models. \% The goal of an fMRI experiments is to answer a neuroscientific question. However, it is usually not possible to perform hypothesis testing directly on the data output by the fMRI scanner. Instead, fMRI data enters a processing pipeline in which it suffers several transformations before conclusions are drawn. Often the data acquired through the fMRI scanner follows a feature extraction step in which time-independent activation coefficients are extracted from the fMRI signal. The first contribution of this thesis is the introduction a model named Rank-1 GLM (R1-GLM) for the joint estimation of time-independent activation coefficients and the hemodynamic response function (HRF). We quantify the improvement of this approach with respect to existing procedures on different fMRI datasets. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the problem of fMRI-based decoding, i.e., the task of predicting some information about the stimuli from brain activation maps. From a statistical standpoint, this problem is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data, often thousands of variables, while the number of images available for training is small, typically a few hundreds. We examine the case in which the target variable consist of discretely ordered values. The second contribution of this thesis is to propose the following two metrics to assess the performance of a decoding model: the absolute error and pairwise disagreement. We describe several models that optimize a convex surrogate of these loss functions and examine their performance on different fMRI datasets. Motivated by the success of some ordinal regression models for the task of fMRI-based decoding, we turn to study some theoretical properties of these methods. The property that we investigate is known as consistency or Fisher consistency and relates the minimization of a loss to the minimization of its surrogate. The third, and most theoretical, contribution of this thesis is to examine the consistency properties of a rich family of surrogate loss functions that are used in the context of ordinal regression. We give sufficient conditions for the consistency of the surrogate loss functions considered. This allows us to give theoretical reasons for some empirically observed differences in performance between surrogates.},

	abstract = {In BOLD fMRI data analysis, robust and accurate estimation of the Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) is still under investigation. Parametric methods assume the shape of the HRF to be known and constant throughout the brain, whereas non‐parametric methods mostly rely on artificially increasing the signal‐to‐noise ratio. We extend and develop a previously proposed method that makes use of basic yet relevant temporal information about the underlying physiological process of the brain BOLD response in order to infer the HRF in a Bayesian framework. A general hypothesis test is also proposed, allowing to take advantage of the knowledge gained regarding the HRF to perform activation detection. The performances of the method are then evaluated by simulation. Great improvement is shown compared to the Maximum‐Likelihood estimate in terms of estimation error, variance, and bias. Robustness of the estimators with regard to the actual noise structure or level, as well as the stimulus sequence, is also proven. Lastly, fMRI data with an event‐related paradigm are analyzed. As suspected, the regions selected from highly discriminating activation maps resulting from the method exhibit a certain inter‐regional homogeneity in term of HRF shape, as well as noticeable inter‐regional differences.

	abstract = {The properties of the hemodynamic latencies in functional maps have been relatively unexplored. Accurate methods of estimating hemodynamic latencies are needed to take advantage of this feature of fMRI. A fully automated, weighted least-squares (WLS) method for estimating temporal latencies is reported. Using a weighted linear model, the optimal latency and amplitude of the fMRI response can be determined for those voxels that pass a detection threshold. There is evidence from previous studies that the hemodynamic response may be time-locked to the stimulus within certain limits, less variable earlier in its evolution, and able to resolve information about relative hemodynamic timing. This information can be used to test hypotheses about the sequence and spatial distribution of neural activity. The method can be used to weight the earliest evolution of the hemodynamic response more heavily and decrease bias resulting from the hemodynamic response function. Additionally, the WLS method can control for varying response shapes across the brain and improve latency comparisons between brain regions. The WLS method was developed to study the properties of hemodynamic latencies, which may be increasingly important as event-related fMRI continues to be advanced.
